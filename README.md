# CodeJam - Combine SAP Cloud Application Programming Model with SAP HANA Cloud to Create Full-Stack Applications

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/cap-hana-exercises-codejam)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/cap-hana-exercises-codejam)

## Description

This repository contains the material for the CodeJam on using the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model and SAP HANA Cloud to create Full-Stack Applications. In this CodeJam we will learn how to use an instance of SAP HANA Cloud, develop a multi-target application using SAP Business Application Studio and SAP Cloud Application Programming Model, and create a service layer and SAP Fiori UI that also includes SAP HANA native artifacts, such as calculation views.

## What is an SAP CodeJam?

SAP CodeJam is a hands-on, collaborative event where developers come together to learn about SAP technologies, share knowledge, and work on practical exercises. These events are typically led by SAP experts and provide a great opportunity to network with peers, ask questions, and gain a deeper understanding of SAP solutions through guided tutorials and real-world scenarios.

## Requirements

The requirements to follow the exercises in this repository, including hardware and software, are detailed in the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file.

### Material organization

The material consists of a series of exercises. Each exercise is contained in a directory, with a main 'readme' file containing the core exercise instructions, with optional supporting files, such as screenshots and sample files.

### Following the exercises

During the CodeJam you will complete each exercise one at a time. At the end of each exercise there are questions; these are designed to help you think about the content just covered, and are to be discussed with the entire CodeJam class, led by the instructor, when everyone has finished that exercise.

If you finish an exercise early, please resist the temptation to continue with the next one. Instead, explore what you've just done and see if you can find out more about the subject that was covered. That way we all stay on track together and can benefit from some reflection via the questions (and answers).

> The exercises are written in a conversational way; this is so that they have enough context and information to be completed outside the hands-on session itself. To help you navigate and find what you have to actually do next, there are pointers like this ðŸ‘‰ throughout that indicate the things you have to actually do (as opposed to just read for background information).

### The exercises

Here's an overview of the exercises in this CodeJam.

## Known Issues

When creating the HDI Container instance in Exercise 3, the Business Application Studio tooling sometimes does not properly wait for the container creation. In these situations, simply wait a moment for creation to complete and then repeat the step.

## Feedback

If you can spare a couple of minutes at the end of the session, please help me improve for next time by giving me some feedback.

Simply use this [Give Feedback](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cap-hana-exercises-codejam/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=session-feedback-template.md&title=Feedback) link to create a special "feedback" issue, and follow the instructions in there.

## Further connections and information

Here are a few pointers to resources for further connections and information:

### What is the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model?

The SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) is a framework of languages, libraries, and tools for building enterprise-grade services and applications. It provides a consistent end-to-end programming model that includes best practices, out-of-the-box solutions for common tasks, and a set of tools to simplify development. CAP is designed to help developers focus on their business logic while leveraging SAP's powerful technologies.

### What is SAP HANA Cloud?

SAP HANA Cloud is a fully managed, in-memory cloud database as a service (DBaaS) that provides advanced data management capabilities. It allows you to manage, store, and process data in real-time, enabling you to build modern applications that require high performance and scalability. SAP HANA Cloud integrates seamlessly with other SAP services and provides tools for data integration, analytics, and application development.
